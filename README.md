# DEEP-NEURAL-NETWORKS-FOR-ROBUST-BONE-AGE-ESTIMATION-IN-PEDIATRIC-RADIOLOGY

### Accurate assessment of bone age is crucial in pediatric radiology for monitoring growth and development.The research introduces a novel bone age estimation approach using deep neural networks (DNNs) in medical image analysis.The system is trained on a dataset of pediatric radiographs to optimize a DNN model capable of accurately estimating bone age based on skeletal development indicators.The DNN's architecture is designed with advanced features to handle complexities in pediatric radiology images, ensuring robust performance across different age groups and anatomical variations.
